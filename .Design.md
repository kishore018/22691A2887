# Design Document â€“ URL Shortener Web App (Frontend)

## ðŸ§± 1. Project Overview

The application is a **React-based URL Shortener** that allows users to:
- Shorten long URLs
- Set custom shortcodes
- Set an optional expiry time (default: 30 minutes)
- View a list of created short URLs
- Redirect users based on the shortcode
- See statistics for all created links

All data is handled **on the client side** using React and **localStorage**, and **custom middleware logging** is integrated across all major functions.
