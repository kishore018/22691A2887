# System Design Document ‚Äì Frontend Assessment (22691A2887)

## üìå Project Overview

This frontend application is a **URL Shortener with Stats View**, built using React. The user can input a long URL and receive a shortened version. The user can also view statistics of all URLs previously shortened.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

| Layer            | Technology Used         | Justification |
|------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Frontend UI      | React                    | Component-based structure, reusable and efficient |
| Routing          | React Router DOM         | SPA navigation and routing between Shortener and Stats pages |
| Styling          | CSS / Custom styling     | Simple, scalable styling without heavy libraries |
| Logging          | Custom Logging Middleware| To track actions like shortening URLs and viewing stats |
| Data Handling    | useState, useEffect      | Lightweight state handling for this scale of app |
| Mock API         | Local simulation via state | Backend not implemented; assumed for design |

## üß† Architectural Design Decisions

1. **Component-Based Structure**
   - Split into `ShortenerPage`, `StatsPage`, and `App.js` with routing.
   - `Logger.js` middleware imported in both components to track actions.

2. **Routing**
   - Used `BrowserRouter`, with two routes: `/shorten` and `/stats`.

3. **Middleware Integration**
   - A reusable `logger` function logs the type of action, timestamp, and payload.
   - Called manually in critical functions for simplicity and visibility.

4. **Mock Data Simulation**
   - API calls were simulated using hardcoded data or useState arrays due to lack of backend.
